\section{Introduction}

Software vulnerabilities, especially those that are remotely exploitable are very widespread and the root cause of security attacks.\cite{cESV}
they are very dangerous because they will frequently allow attackers to completely take over the software and steal data, or prevent the software from operating.\cite{introduction}

The aim of this project is to investigate about software vulnerabilities such as SQL- Injection, Cross Site scripting and Cross Site Request Forgery.
